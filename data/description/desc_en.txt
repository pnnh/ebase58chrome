eBase58 tool can convert strings to Base58 encoding format or restore Base58-encoded strings to their original content. This is commonly used in scenarios such as blockchain addresses and supports multiple Base58 encoding styles.

Base58 can also be used to encode complex strings, and the resulting string does not contain easily confused characters, making it easy for humans to read and suitable for transmission as URL parameters.

Advantages of Base58:

- Human-readable, avoids visually confusing characters, suitable for manual input.
- URL-safe, character set does not require escaping, suitable for web applications.
- Compactness, about 31.75% shorter than hexadecimal, suitable for storage and transmission.

Example application scenarios for Base58:

- Bitcoin address: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTefTL5SLmv7DivfNax
- Encoding URL parameters to form easy-to-read short links: https://sfx.xyz/Cn8eVZg
- Encoding UUID 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 with Base58: 9m4e2mr0ui3e8a215n4g, the length is shortened
- IPFS InterPlanetary File System content addressing, IPFS CID: QmXoypizjW3WknFsiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDuP1mXWo6ucoa
- Encrypting keys, encoding private keys or seeds: 5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPugD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvyTJt

Notes:

- Base58 is case-sensitive, so systems must handle it correctly.
- Although Base58 is shorter than hexadecimal, it is still about 36.5% longer than the original binary data, so storage requirements should be considered.
